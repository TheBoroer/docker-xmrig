# XMRig Miner

[XMRig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) based on a Ubuntu Xenial Image.

I try to keep this up to date with the official XMRig Releases [(Available Here)](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases)

#### Available Version/Image Tags:
- `v2.8.3` ( `latest` )
- `v2.6.2`

# How to use
```bash
# docker run --restart unless-stopped --read-only boro/xmrig:latest -o POOL01 -u WALLET -p PASSWORD
```

All standard XMRig arguments are supported, using `--help` will list all of them.
```bash
# docker run boro/xmrig:latest --help
```
